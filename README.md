# CO2 Emission Reduction Analytics Platform

## Business Value for SITA

This platform directly supports SITA's mission to reduce aviation's carbon footprint through data intelligence. By visualizing and analyzing flight emissions data, airlines can:

- **Reduce Fuel Costs**: Identify and implement optimizations that can save thousands of euros per flight
- **Meet Sustainability Goals**: Track, measure, and report CO2 reduction progress
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Stay ahead of increasingly strict emissions regulations
- **Competitive Advantage**: Offer greener flight options to environmentally conscious travelers
- **Direct ROI Calculation**: See the financial impact of each emission reduction strategy

## Perfect Fit for SITA's Mission

The platform aligns perfectly with SITA's Data Intelligence team goals mentioned in the job posting:

> "The Data Intelligence team develops and deploys data-driven and AI-powered solutions to optimize operations in the aviation industry, with a specific focus on reducing the sector's CO2 emissions. For example, SITA OptiClimb helps to save fuel for each climb by computing optimal climb speeds..."

Our platform showcases exactly this expertise, featuring SITA OptiClimb technology.

## Technology Stack

We built this using modern, powerful tools that are familiar to the SITA team:

- **Python**: The core programming language for data analysis
- **Streamlit**: For creating the interactive web dashboard without complex web development
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For efficient data processing and analysis
- **Plotly**: For beautiful, interactive data visualizations
- **Machine Learning Models**: For emissions predictions and optimization recommendations

## How It Works

The platform is simple to use but powerful in its analysis:

1. **Data Input**: Upload flight operations data or use our synthetic data generator
2. **Dashboard Overview**: See total emissions, fuel consumption, and potential savings at a glance
3. **Flight Analysis**: Analyze how aircraft type, route, weather, and flight level affect emissions
4. **Scenario Testing**: Try different intervention strategies and see their impact:
   - Optimize climb profiles with SITA OptiClimb
   - Reduce aircraft weight
   - Improve flight routing
   - Implement regular engine washing
5. **Route Optimization**: Identify which routes offer the greatest savings potential
6. **Financial Impact**: Calculate both cost savings and carbon credit benefits

## Key Visualizations

The platform includes intuitive visualizations for non-technical stakeholders:

- Emissions by aircraft type comparison
- Route efficiency maps with color-coded emissions
- Before/after intervention comparison charts
- Monthly emissions trends
- ROI calculator for emissions reduction strategies
